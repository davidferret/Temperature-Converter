# Temperature Conversion Project

This C project does temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The way it works is by letting you input a temperature value and select the unit you want to convert it to.

You can convert a single value or process multiple conversions in batch mode, specifying the level of precision you need. The project also supports Kelvin conversions alongside Celsius and Fahrenheit, making it more versatile. If you want to keep track of your conversions, there's an option to save the results to a file. Additionally, a reference conversion table can be generated for quick lookup of Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions.

I created this project because I wanted a simple and efficient way to handle temperature conversions without relying on online calculators. It was a great challenge to implement batch processing and precision control while keeping the interface easy to use. Whether youâ€™re converting a single value or generating a full conversion table, this project makes the process straightforward and accessible.

## Example Output
```
Enter the number of conversions: 3
Enter decimal precision (0-5): 3

Enter temperature value followed by unit (C/F): 100 C
100.000 Celsius is 212.000 Fahrenheit

Enter temperature value followed by unit (C/F): 50 F
50.000 Fahrenheit is 10.000 Celsius

Enter temperature value followed by unit (C/F): 37 C
37.000 Celsius is 98.600 Fahrenheit

```
